<h1 style=font-size:50px; text-align:center:">LOVE</h1>

<p>Love is sacrifice, love is pain, love is patience, love is sharing, love is honesty, love is unwavering, love intergral, love is respect.<br> In all things love is patience.<br> Maybe love is unhealthy.<br> But nothing compares to a feeling, when you find somebody who chnges the world, who changes how you see things and how you see yourself.<br> You know its time for you to hold on that feeling.<br> But nothing last forever without patience.<br> Most importantly love comes to you, if you go looking for it you are not going to see it because love comes to you its like a gift.<p>
